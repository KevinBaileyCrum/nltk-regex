This is the Readme for asg 2

You will notice the three parts are in their respictive folders.  Their outfiles
exist in their respective directories as well.

## Part1
notice the last portion, part 3 is not functioning.

## Part2
not much to report, the word I hardcoded to inspect
was the noun of set.  I figured it would be an interesting
one.  The verb would have been interesting too.  I redirected
the output by overloading stdout using the sys library.

## Part3
Notice the output files are not exactly as specified by project discription.

### Part3.3
Although the answers were generated by my code, I did them by hand and wrote it by hand. Part3 wont do any of this 
output on its own nor will it write a language-model-answers.txt file.  I was under the impression this
was to be done by hand hence the 'write down your answers..'
